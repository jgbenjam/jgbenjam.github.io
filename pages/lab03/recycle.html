			<h3>Recycling Tips</h3>
			
			Get into the habit of recycling, and it will become second nature. Here are some tips that will help you:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Bottles, cans and jars:
					<ol>
						<li><em>All bottles, cans and jars must be empty.</em></li>
						<li>Take the lids off of all bottles, cans and jars and rinse them.</li>
						<li>Throw all metals lids into the recycling box.</li>
						<li>Throw plastic lids that bend easily into the recycling box.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Leaf and yard waste can be placed in paper bags. You can also use yard waste to make compost for your garden. <a id = "composting" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost" target = "_blank">How to make compost</a></li>
				<li>Green bins can be used for kitchen waste.</li>
			</ul>
