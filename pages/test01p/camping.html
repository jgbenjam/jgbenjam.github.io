		<h1>Camping</h1>	
		
		Camping is an outdoor recreational activity. The participants 
		(known as campers) leave urban areas, their home region, or 
		civilization and enjoy nature while spending one or several 
		nights outdoors, usually at a campsite. Camping may involve 
		the use of a tent, caravan, motorhome, cabin, a primitive 
		structure, or no shelter at all. In many parts of the world, 
		camping refers exclusively to the use of tents or similar 
		portable structures. Camping as a recreational activity became
		popular in the early 20th century. Campers frequent national 
		or state parks, other publicly owned natural areas, and privately
		owned campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations
		around the world, such as scouting. It is used to teach 
		self-reliance and teamwork. Camping is also used as a inexpensive
		form of accommodation for people attending large open air events
		such as sporting meetings and music festivals. Organizers often 
		provide a field and other basic amenities. Information on this

		Camping describes a <strong>range of activities</strong>. Survivalist campers set off
		with little more than their boots, whereas recreational vehicle 
		travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and 
		patio furniture. Camping is often enjoyed in conjunction with 
		activities, such as: <em>canoeing, climbing, fishing, hill walking,
		mountain biking, motorcycling, swimming, and whitewater kayaking</em>.
		Camping may also be combined with hiking, either as backpacking 
		or as a series of day hikes from a central location.
		
		<h3>Specialized Camping</h3>
		
		<strong><em>Adventure camping</strong></em> is a form of camping by people who race 
		(possibly adventure racing or mountain biking) during the day,
		and camp in a minimalist way at night. They might use the basic
		items of camping equipment such as a micro-camping stove, 
		sleeping bag, and bivouac bag.
		
		<strong><em>Glamping (glamorous camping)</strong></em> is a growing global phenomenon 
		that combines camping with the luxury and amenities of a home 
		or hotel. Also called boutique camping, luxury camping, posh 
		camping or comfy camping, glamping allows travelers to experience
		nature without the hassle of finding camp space, carrying their 
		tents, and erecting and taking down their own tents. Lodgings at
		a glamping sites (glampsites) include structures such as yurts, 
		tipis, pods, bell tents, safari tents, tent cabins, and tree houses.
		Glampsites range in price from as little as $50 per night to 
		thousands of dollars per night, depending on the level of luxury.
		Sites offer amenities such as fresh bed linens, en suite washrooms,
		food service, private verandas, and, most importantly, direct 
		access to the great outdoors.
