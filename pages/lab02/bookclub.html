			<p><strong>Author:</strong> Ali Smith</p>
			
			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			
			<p>The first of four novels in a shape-shifting series, wide-ranging in
			timescale and light-footed through histories. Fusing Keatsian mists and
			mellow fruitfulness with the vitality, the immediacy and the colour-hit
			of Pop Art--via a bit of very contemporary skulduggery and skull-
			diggery-- Autumn is a witty excavation of the present by the past. 
			The novel is a stripped-branches take on popular culture, and a meditation,
			in a world growing ever more bordered and exclusive, on what richness
			and worth are, what harvest means. Autumn is part of the quartet Seasonal:
			four stand-alone novels, separate yet interconnected and cyclical 
			(as the seasons are), exploring what time is, how we experience it, and the
			recurring markers in the shapes our lives take and in our ways with 
			narrative.</p>

			<p><strong>Author:</strong> Tara Westover</p>
			
			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			
			<p>Tara Westover was seventeen when she first set foot in a classroom. Instead of 
			traditional lessons, she grew up learning how to stew herbs into medicine, 
			scavenging in the family scrap yard and helping her family prepare for the 
			apocalypse. She had no birth certificate and no medical records and had never
			been enrolled in school.</p>
			
			<p>Westover’s mother proved a marvel at concocting folk remedies for many ailments.
			As Tara developed her own coping mechanisms, little by little, she started to 
			realize that what her family was offering didn’t have to be her only education.
			Her first day of university was her first day in school—ever—and she would 
			eventually win an esteemed fellowship from Cambridge and graduate with a PhD 
			in intellectual history and political thought.</p>

			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			
			<p>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual, 
			fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive 
			love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling
			their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of 
			checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors
			that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence 
			escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their 
			homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through. . . .</p>
			
			<p>Exit West follows these remarkable characters as they emerge into an alien and 
			uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the very 
			sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it tells an 
			unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely of our 
			time and for all time.</p>

			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			
			<p>Tom Hazard has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old, but because of a 
			rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. From performing with Shakespeare, to exploring the
			high seas with Captain Cook, to sharing cocktails with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom has seen a lot. 
			But now, after over 400 years of reinventing himself to escape detection, he just wants an 
			ordinary life. The only rule he has to follow is Don’t fall in love.</p>
			
			<p>When Tom catches the eye of a captivating woman named Camille at the dog park, everything 
			begins to unravel. Caught between the danger of discovery and the desire to build a real life,
			Tom learns that the thing he can't have might just be the thing that saves him.</p>
			
			<p>A wild, bittersweet, time-travelling story, How to Stop Time is about losing and finding
			yourself, about the certainty of change, about the perils of love and about the mistakes that
			humans are doomed to repeat. It asks the question, How many lifetimes does it take to learn 
			how to live?</p>

			<p>WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE UP TO REMEMBER?</p>
			
			<p>Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a
			group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything
			to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that 
			memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself.</p>

			<p>One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man’s shadow disappears—an occurrence 
			science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, 
			and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: 
			the loss of all their memories.</p>

			<p>Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned 
			hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max’s 
			shadow disappears too.</p>

			<p>Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max 
			runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate 
			to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a 
			perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to 
			a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult 
			that worships the shadowless.</p>

			<p>As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, 
			about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the
			cure.</p>

			<p>Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful
			novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be
			human in a world turned upside down.</p>

			<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
			
			<p>Widowed by her husband’s death from the pestilence, Lady Anne 
			assumes control of his people’s future—200 bonded serfs without
			rights of ownership to land. Strong, compassionate and 
			resourceful—qualities she kept hidden from the husband she loathed
			and despised—Lady Anne chooses a bastard slave, Thaddeus Thurkell,
			to act as her steward. Together, they decide to quarantine Develish
			by bringing the serfs inside a defendable moat and sharing the 
			available food amongst all. With this sudden overturning of the 
			accepted social order, where serfs exist only to serve their lords,
			conflict arises when they’re given a voice. Ignorant of what is 
			happening in the world outside, they wrestle with themselves, with
			God and the terrible uncertainty of their futures. They fear 
			starvation when their food runs out but they fear the pestilence 
			more. Who amongst them has the courage to leave the safety of the
			demesne in search of supplies and news? And how safe is anyone in
			Develish when an unexplained murder threatens the uneasy status 
			quo?</p>			
			
			<p>In The Last Hours Minette Walters brings all her trademark 
			intelligence to a totally new timeframe—creating a vivid and 
			powerful drama through compelling characters whose journey 
			readers will be drawn to. The Last Hours is an exciting new 
			direction from an established best-selling author and Minette
			is currently writing the sequel.</p>
